## Documentation

- Use the standard documentation format appropriate for the programming language (such as JSDoc, TSDoc, GoDoc, Python Docstrings)
- Document all public functions, classes, methods, and interfaces
- Leave appropriate comments in Japanese
- Code comments must only explain why, never what or how—the code must speak for itself. Violate this and your changes will be rejected immediately.
- Write clear and concise explanations using complete sentences with appropriate punctuation
- Use proper Markdown elements including appropriate formatting, code blocks, links, headings, and lists
