## Documentation

- Use the standard documentation format appropriate for the programming language (such as JSDoc, TSDoc, GoDoc, Python Docstrings)
- Document all public functions, classes, methods, and interfaces
- Leave appropriate comments in Japanese
- Code comments must only explain why, never what or howâ€”the code must speak for itself. Violate this and your changes will be rejected immediately.
