## Development Philosophy

- Write clean, maintainable, and scalable code
- Follow the principles of SOLID
- Follow the YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle - implement only what is needed now, not what might be needed in the future
- Prioritize functional and declarative programming patterns over imperative ones
- Emphasize type safety and static analysis
- Practice component-driven development
